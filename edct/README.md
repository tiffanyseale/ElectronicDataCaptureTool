For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).


ALSO! In order to the HTTP calls to work on the same machine, you need install Moesif Orign & CORS Changer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en-US) as a chrome extension and turn it ON. ONLY TURN IT ON WHEN USING THIS THEN TURN IT BACK OFF. DO NOT FORGET TO TURN IT BACK OFF.

There is also the option to append a proxy in front of the url's inside of the http calls, every website I tried was down when I was testing the functionality.
